    "As we stated in previous notebooks, using a single image is not enough to infer 3D information of the scene, since all the 3D points lying on the ray starting from the camera's optical center and passing through a certain pixel **project to that same pixel**. This way, generally we can't infer the depth having only one image. However, in some situations depth can be estimated with the help of 3D visual cues from **shading, texture, focus, perspective, motion, optical flow** or **occlusion**. Some examples of this:$\\\\[3pt]$\n",

Of course, errors in determing either the focal length or the baseline influences the final error, but they can be estimated more precisely. $\\\\[5pt]$\n",
