    "# 8.1 Mathematical tools for image formation\n",
    "\n",
    "Image formation is the process of projecting the elements appearing in a **3D scene** (objects, surfaces, landscapes, etc.) on a **2D image plane**. This process happens, for instance, when you are capturing an image of the real world by means of a camera, or when you are playing a first-person videogame and the 3D virtual environment of the game is projected to a plane that is shown to you as the player's view.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this introductory notebook, we will see some basic mathematical tools that are required for studying image formation models as the common pinhole model. Although it might seem at first that they are not related with the problem at hand, their understanding is of capital importance when studying about elements and transformations between the 3D world and the 2D image plane. \n",

    "In video games, it is called *first person* to any graphical perspective rendered from the viewpoint of the player's character, or a viewpoint from the cockpit or front seat of a vehicle driven by the character. Many genres incorporate first-person perspectives, including adventure games, driving, sailing, and flight simulators. Perhaps the more extended are first-person shooters, in which the graphical perspective is an integral component of the gameplay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, when someone plays a first-person computer game, the `WASD` keys of our keyboard are used to move the camera position in the $x$ and $z$ axes (planar movement) and `SPACE` is used for jumping (this moves the camera in the $y$ axis, hence allowing it to move in 3D). Then, the mouse is used for changing the camera orientation (this applies *pitch* and/or *yaw* rotations to the camera coordinate system). The combination of 3D movement and 3D rotations creates a full 6D motion control for our character!\n",
