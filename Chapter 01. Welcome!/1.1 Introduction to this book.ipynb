    "This book addresses the fundamental topics of computer vision in a *interactive spirit*. It is implemented using the **Jupyter Notebook** technology, so the *reader* can, in addition to learn the theory behind core computer vision techniques, experiment those techniques by playing with their code and execution (if this is your first time with Jupyter notebooks, [this one](../Chapter%2012.%20Appendices/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Jupyter%20and%20Python.ipynb) in the book's appendices could help you to gain insight into them). It is divided into chapters, and each chapter covers a different computer vision problem, e.g. edge detection, region segmentation, stereo vision, etc. (for an exhaustive list, take a look at the [Table of contents](./1.2%20Table%20of%20contents.ipynb)).\n",

    "Some possible definitions are:\n",
    "- The process to **extract information** from images using a computer (software).\n",
    "- A system that performs the **tasks that human vision does**. These tasks can go from the detection of simple objects to the understanding of a whole, complex scene (see Fig. 1. and Fig. 2).\n",

    "- **Image processing** (IP): image smoothing, image enhancement, etc.\n",
    "- **Machine learning** (ML): classification models, detection algorithms, etc.\n",
    "- **Computer graphics** (CG): camera models, illumination models, etc.\n",

    "- Industry (production lines),\n",
    "- Medicine (image lab analysis like cell counting or cell health, diagnosis through echography or magnetic resonance, etc.),\n",
    "- Security, surveillance,\n",
    "- Driving assistance,\n",
